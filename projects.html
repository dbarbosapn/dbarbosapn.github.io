						<strong>garçon?</strong> is a pair of mobile apps inspired on
						self-service kiosks. With this app, the customers of restaurants,
						pharmacies, clothes stores and many others are able to make their
						purchases and pay them through the phone or at the store and receive
						updates of how their order is going. This way, they can skip the
						lines by just going there and taking their products when they're

						data in real time and, as long as the noise is below a certain
						level, there is an image of an icecream that keeps filling. This app
						was used in the canteen of a school in order to motivate kids to do
						less noise and they'd get an icecream as a reward. It also has a
						back-office full of charts and other cool configurations for the
						school directors.
